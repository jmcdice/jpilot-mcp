# jpilot-mcp

MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server for Jira - Agent-friendly Jira integration.

## Overview

jpilot-mcp is an MCP server that provides AI agents with direct access to Jira operations. It exposes a set of focused, type-safe tools for managing Jira issues, enabling agents to create epics, stories, tasks, subtasks, and manage issue workflows.

Built with [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) and the official Jira Python library, jpilot-mcp makes it easy for AI agents to interact with Jira through natural language commands.

**Perfect for:**
- Managing Jira issues from Claude Desktop, Augment Code, or any MCP-compatible client
- Automating Jira workflows with AI agents
- Creating and tracking issues without leaving your development environment
- Building custom Jira integrations with natural language

## Recent Updates

```

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (tested with Python 3.13)
- Jira Cloud account with API token
- MCP-compatible client:
  - [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
  - [Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/) (VS Code, JetBrains, or CLI)
  - [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)
  - Any other MCP-compatible client

## Installation

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
cd ~/dev/jpilot-mcp
./setup.sh
```

The setup script will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Create a `.env` file from the template

Then edit `.env` with your Jira credentials.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Clone or navigate to the project:
```bash
cd ~/dev/jpilot-mcp
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the package in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Configure your Jira credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Jira server, email, and API token
```

### Getting Your Jira API Token

1. Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click **"Create API token"**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "jpilot-mcp")
4. Copy the token - you'll need it for configuration
5. Your Jira server URL is typically: `https://your-company.atlassian.net`

## Configuration for MCP Clients

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config file (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jpilot": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "jpilot_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "JIRA_SERVER": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
        "JIRA_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token",
        "JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT": "PROJ"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Optional**: Set `JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT` to your most-used project key (e.g., `"CIT"`) to avoid specifying it in every command.

**Note**: Use the full path to Python if needed:
```json
"command": "/path/to/jpilot-mcp/.venv/bin/python"
```

Restart Claude Desktop after making changes.

### Augment Code (Auggie CLI)

#### Option 1: Using add-json Command (Recommended)

```bash
auggie mcp add-json jpilot '{
  "command": "/path/to/jpilot-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
  "args": ["-m", "jpilot_mcp.server"],
  "env": {
    "JIRA_SERVER": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
    "JIRA_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
    "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token",
    "JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT": "PROJ"
  }
}'
```

**Optional**: Set `JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT` to your most-used project key (e.g., `"CIT"`) to avoid specifying it in every command.

**Note**: Replace `/path/to/jpilot-mcp/.venv/bin/python` with the actual path to your virtual environment's Python.

#### Option 2: Manual Configuration

Edit `~/.augment/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jpilot": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "jpilot_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "JIRA_SERVER": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
        "JIRA_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Verify installation:
```bash
auggie mcp list
```

In interactive mode, check status:
```bash
auggie
/mcp-status
```

**Tip**: If you encounter issues with the `--env` flags, use the `add-json` method instead, which handles complex configurations more reliably.

#### Quick Setup Script

You can create a setup script for easy configuration:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup_auggie.sh

auggie mcp add-json jpilot '{
  "command": "/path/to/jpilot-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
  "args": ["-m", "jpilot_mcp.server"],
  "env": {
    "JIRA_SERVER": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
    "JIRA_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
    "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
  }
}'

echo "✓ jpilot-mcp configured for Auggie"
echo "Test with: auggie \"List all my Jira projects\""
```

Make it executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x setup_auggie.sh
./setup_auggie.sh
```

### Augment Code (VS Code Extension)

1. Open VS Code
2. Open the Augment panel
3. Click the **settings icon** (⋮) → **Settings**
4. In the MCP section, click **Import from JSON**
5. Paste the configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jpilot": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "jpilot_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "JIRA_SERVER": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
        "JIRA_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

6. Click **Save**

### Other MCP Clients

jpilot-mcp uses stdio transport and follows the MCP specification. Configure it in your client using:
- **Command**: `python -m jpilot_mcp.server`
- **Environment variables**: `JIRA_SERVER`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, `JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT` (optional)

## Default Project Configuration

You can optionally set a default project to avoid specifying `project_key` in every command:

```bash
export JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT=CIT
```

Or in your MCP client configuration:
```json
"env": {
  "JIRA_SERVER": "https://your-domain.atlassian.net",
  "JIRA_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
  "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token",
  "JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT": "CIT"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Shorter commands: `"List all epics"` instead of `"List all epics in CIT"`
- Less repetition when working primarily on one project
- Can still override by explicitly specifying a different project

**Example usage with default project:**
```bash
# Without default project:
auggie "List all epics in CIT"
auggie "Create a task in CIT with summary 'Update docs'"

# With JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT=CIT:
auggie "List all epics"
auggie "Create a task with summary 'Update docs'"

# Can still override:
auggie "List all epics in PROJ"  # Uses PROJ instead of CIT
```

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can interact with Jira naturally through your MCP client.

### Claude Desktop Examples

**Discovery:**
- "List all my Jira projects"
- "What issue types are available?" (uses default project if set)
- "What issue types are available in project PROJ?" (explicit project)
- "Show me all open issues assigned to me" (uses default project)
- "Show me all epics in PROJ" (explicit project)

**Creating Issues:**
- "Create an epic called 'Q4 2024 Features'" (uses default project)
- "Create an epic 'Q4 Features' in project PROJ" (explicit project)
- "Create a story 'Implement user authentication' under epic PROJ-100"
- "Create a task 'Update API documentation'"

- "Move PROJ-123 to In Progress"

**Complex Workflows:**
- "Create an epic for the new payment system, then create 3 stories under it for frontend, backend, and testing"
- "Find all bugs assigned to me and list them with their status"
- "Show me all issues that are in review"

### Augment Code (Auggie CLI) Examples

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
auggie
```

Then use natural language:
```
List all my Jira projects

Show me all open issues

List all epics

Create an epic called "Authentication System"

Add a comment to PROJ-123 saying "Implemented the new feature"

Move PROJ-123 to Done
```

**One-Shot Commands:**
```bash
# Quick queries (with default project)
auggie "List all open bugs"
auggie "Show me all epics"

# Quick queries (explicit project)
auggie "List all open bugs in project PROJ"

# Create issues (with default project)
auggie "Create a task for updating the API documentation"

# Create issues (explicit project)
auggie "Create a task in PROJ for updating the API documentation"

# Complex workflows
auggie "Create an epic for the new dashboard, then create 3 tasks under it"
```

**Automation Examples:**
```bash
# In your CI/CD pipeline
auggie "Create a Jira task for deploying version $VERSION to production"

# Git hooks
auggie "Add a comment to PROJ-123 with the commit message: $(git log -1 --pretty=%B)"

# Scheduled tasks
auggie "List all issues in PROJ that haven't been updated in 30 days"
```

### Augment Code (VS Code) Examples

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Error: "Failed to connect to Jira"**
- Verify your `JIRA_SERVER` URL is correct (should be `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`)
- Check that your API token is valid
- Ensure your email matches the Jira account

**Error: "Missing required environment variables"**
- Make sure you've created the `.env` file
- Verify all three variables are set: `JIRA_SERVER`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`
- If using Claude Desktop, check the environment variables in the config file

### Default Project Issues

**Error: "No project_key provided and no JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT configured"**
- Either specify the project explicitly: `"List all epics in CIT"`
- Or set `JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT` in your environment configuration
- Example: Add `"JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT": "CIT"` to your MCP client config

### Issue Creation Issues

**Error: "Specify a valid issue type"**
- Use `get_jira_issue_types` to see available issue types for your project
- Issue type names are case-sensitive
- Some projects may not have all standard issue types (Epic, Story, Task)

**Error: "Field X is required"**
- Some Jira projects have required custom fields
- The MCP server currently only supports standard fields
- You may need to create issues manually in Jira if custom fields are required

### List Results Issues

**Problem: "Only seeing 1 result when there should be more"**
- This was fixed in v0.2.0 - make sure you're running the latest version
- Run `git pull` and `pip install -e .` to update
- Restart your MCP client after updating

**Problem: "Descriptions showing as PropertyHolder objects"**
- This was fixed in v0.2.0 with the ADF parser
- Update to the latest version and restart your MCP client
- Descriptions and comments now display as readable plain text

### Claude Desktop Not Showing Tools

1. Check the config file location: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Verify the JSON syntax is valid
3. Restart Claude Desktop after making config changes
4. Check Claude Desktop logs for errors

### Auggie CLI Issues

**Tools not available:**
```bash
# Verify jpilot is configured
auggie mcp list

# Reconfigure if needed
cd ~/dev/jpilot-mcp/scratch
./bleh.sh

# Restart Auggie
auggie
```

**MCP server not starting:**
- Check Python path in configuration is correct
- Verify virtual environment exists: `ls ~/dev/jpilot-mcp/.venv/bin/python`
- Test server manually: `source .venv/bin/activate && python -m jpilot_mcp.server`

## Notes

- **Rich Text Support**: Jira uses Atlassian Document Format (ADF) for rich text. jpilot-mcp automatically converts ADF to readable plain text for descriptions and comments, preserving formatting like bold, lists, and code blocks
- **Markdown Support**: When creating issues, descriptions and comments support markdown formatting, which is automatically converted to Jira's ADF
- **Default Project**: Set `JIRA_DEFAULT_PROJECT` to avoid specifying project in every command. You can still override by explicitly mentioning a different project
- **Complete Results**: All list-returning tools return complete results (not truncated). The `issues` array contains all matching items
- **Assignee Flexibility**: When assigning issues, you can use display names, email addresses, or Jira account IDs
- **Parent Relationships**: Stories can be linked to Epics, Tasks can be linked to Epics or Stories, and Subtasks must have a parent Story or Task
- **Status Transitions**: Available transitions depend on your Jira workflow configuration. Use `get_jira_transitions` to see what's available for each issue
- **Rate Limiting**: Jira Cloud has API rate limits. The server handles this gracefully, but very high-frequency operations may be throttled
